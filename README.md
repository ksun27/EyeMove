# EyeMove
PilotDC 2015 "Most Innovative" Project Award

Moves a mouse cursor based on where a user is looking on the screen, and left/right clicks based on left/right blinks.

Uses the win32 api and OpenCV, and loads two HAAR classifiers for the face and eyes to determine offsets from center screen.
